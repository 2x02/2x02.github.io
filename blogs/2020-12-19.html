                interpersonal organizations are
                vast wellsprings of data for building profiles, unusually while focusing on somebody.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: teal;">Domain names</strong> : These are enrolled by organizations, governments,
                public and private
                organizations, and individuals. Subsequently, when you need to observe somebody, they are an
                extraordinary beginning stage. These can be easily discoverable by inspecting domain name information of
                private information, associated domains, projects, services, and technologies.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: teal;">Internet servers</strong> : An Authoritative DNS server is an incredible
                wellspring of data, as
                they frequently incorporate each surface point uncovered on the Internet - which means an immediate
                connection to related administrations, for example, HTTP, email, and so forth.</p>
            <h2>Information gathering tools:</h2>

            <p><strong style="color: teal;">Google Hacking:</strong> Google hacking is the utilization of web crawlers,
                for example, Google
                to distinguish security weaknesses on the Internet. Two sorts of vulnerabilities are regularly found on
                the web one is programming weaknesses and misconfigurations(errors).</p>
            <p>And the fact that some complex intruders focus on a particular framework and attempt to find weaknesses
                that will permit them access. Most of the intruders start finding particular programming vulnerability
                or basic client misconfiguration that they already know how to misuse, and simply attempt to look or
                scan for systems that have this vulnerability.</p>
            <p>With the help of google, an attacker can gain access to webcams with public access, gain access to
                sensitive Gdrives and Folders, gain access to Drive documents with sensitive information i.e passwords.
            </p>
            <p><strong style="color: teal;">Recon-NG:</strong> Recon-NG is a web reconnaissance framework written in
                Python programming.
                It&#39;s a complete automation modular framework, database interactions, interactive assistance,
                Recon-ng is an incredible TUI tool in which reconnaissance can be led rapidly and adequately.</p>
            <p>While using it you will feel similar to the Metasploit Framework, but it is quite different. It is
                exclusively designed for web-based reconnaissance.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: teal;">Shodan:</strong> Shodan is the web crawler for everything on the web. While
                Google and other web
                crawlers only list the web (index), shodan list (index) everything such as - webcams, hydro medical
                facilities sources, boats, medical and medical type equipment, traffic signals, wind turbines, license
                records, Smart TV, and devices information, AC, anything, and everything. It contains all that is
                associated with the web.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: teal;">Pastebin:</strong> Pastebin is a site that permits clients to share texts or
                code through open
                posts called &quot;pastes&quot;. The site at present has 17 million unique monthly visitors.</p>
            <p>It mainly supports inoffensive content sharing, additionally turns into a well-known platform for hacking
                and illegal operations. For example, breached data and other sensitive information, software
                vulnerabilities, illegal access to a website, dark web links, copyrighted information of banks, credit
                card, or financial information, pornographic information, etc.</p>
            <p>These are examples of how pastes sites are utilized by blackhats. Pastebin is especially easy to
                understand, one can post lots of text files, it doesn&#39;t need client enrollment, it permits unknown
                posting if the client has a VPN.</p>
            <p>It depends on users reporting to a paste, which means that non-compliant pastes are not generally flagged
                as spam or taken out right away immediately. This permits blackhat hackers to effectively and namelessly
                access information in an open area.</p>
            <p><strong style="color: teal;">HTTrack Web Site Copier:</strong> HTTrack is a free and offline site copier

            <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
            <p>Gathering data is one of the underlying advances taken during most infosec investigations, and there are
                numerous approaches to do it, with various methods and tools. While exploring any objective, you will be
                shocked how much information you get about the host.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you get a lot of relevant information, on other occasions you come up with useless data, and,
                still, in other scenarios, good data and only noise will be combined. It takes time to collect all of
                this data, and it can be even harder to drink all the different pieces of cyberspace trails you've got,
                clean up all the garbage, and just get the useful and important parts ... But don't worry, that's why we
                are here to help you.</p>
