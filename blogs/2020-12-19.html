            <h1 style="color: white;">What is Information Gathering</h1>
            <p>Gathering information is the initial stage where a hacker tries to obtain information about the victim.
                Hackers utilize different sources and tools to extract more information, and those snippets of data will
                get value for a hacker to get into your organization or your gadgets.</p>

            <ul>
                <li style="color: aliceblue;"><strong style="color: teal;">Footprinting &amp; Scanning</strong> : This includes public, private, and associated domain
                    names, SSL certificates, network hosts, Open Ports, public and private IP blocks, routing tables,
                    TCP and UDP running services, and more.</li>
                <li style="color: aliceblue;"><strong style="color: teal;">Enumeration</strong> : This includes OS hostnames, user enumeration, system banners, system
                    groups, OS type fingerprinting, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While there is a lot to cover, you will find out about it by investigating the most famous methods
                utilized during this stage.</p>

            <h2>Information gathering techniques :</h2>
            <p>Commonly, hackers use an assortment of strategies and tools to acquire this valuable data for their
                targets, for example, data from social media and online job profile locales to use toward a data
